## Benson Project

### Overview

My first project at Metis challenged my partner and I to optimize the allocation of street teams in order to maximize attendance and donations at an upcoming gala hosted by the WTWY.  To accomplish this task we were specifically asked to use MTA subway data and we decided to supplement this data with data from the U.S census and the locations of tech companies in NYC.

### Method

**Understand the project**
- First, we looked at what type of people the WTWY was most interested in attracting to the gala.  We understood that it is a fundraising event so the desired population should have disposable income.  Because of this we used U.S. census data to find the areas of New York City with the highest average/median incomes.  We then thought that just having money wasn't going to be enough and we should further narrow our search.  From this we decided to only consider posting our street teams in areas where tech companies are prevelant. Combining these considerations with the mta data we were able to find a few subway stations that we could recommend.

**Gather and clean the data**

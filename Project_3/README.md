# Predicting credit card defaults

# Sumary

In my third project at Metis I took on a classification problem where the target was whether or not a credit card holder will default on their balance.  The data was gathered from the UCI machine learning website and focused on credit card holders from Taiwan. I tested a variety of models and chose the best one to analyze further.  I added a profit function that I then maximized.  The conclusions reached from this model are that at the current accuracy level of the model and the current rate that debt collectors are willing to pay result in a maximized profit function when nearly everyone is chosen to not default. As a result the lendor then choses to never sell the borrowers debt.  We can see that this number changes as the rate that a debt collector is willing to pay increases. Additionally we can infer that if the accuracy of the model were to increase we would be more willing to classify more borrowers in the default class.

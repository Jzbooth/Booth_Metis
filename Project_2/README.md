## Overview

The purpose of this project was to use a linear regression model in order to determine which statistics are most relevant when predicting a player's salary.  This was done by first scraping data from different webisites.  Then performing some exploratory analysis while cleaning the data. After the data is in a useable format a regression was done, at which point I could narrow down the number of features to optimize the model.

    "\n",
    "_Structured Query Language_ (SQL) is a very useful [declarative language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) for working with data. It is usually supported (with some variation) by relational databases. The tutorialspoint [SQL Quick Guide](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-quick-guide.htm) is a handy cheat sheet for a lot of the syntax. As a data user, access to data will usually consist of a more or less complicated `SELECT` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For joining data with SQL, this [Visual Explanation of SQL Joins](http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/) is quite good. One thing to note is that \"join\" will also often be known as \"merge\" in statistical software.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab uses the SQL playground provided in-browser by [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/). Click [W3Schools SQL playground](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) to go straight to the playground.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pre-populated data environment with nothing to install and no risk of breaking anything. The data there is from a commonly-used example database ([info](http://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/)). Nice!\n",

## My Metis Career

I have been lucky enough to be chosen to attend the Metis data science program as part of the 2018 winter cohort.  On this blog I will be documenting my time in the program and will post all of my projects.

## Visualizing MTA subway data

[Project details](https://jzbooth.github.io/Booth_Metis/Project_1/)

In my first project at Metis I was assigned a team member and we were tasked with optimizing the placement of street teams for advertising an upcoming fundraising event.  In this project we were given NYC turnstile data to use to determine the subway terminals with the most foot traffic.  Beyond this data set we were encouraged to make more assumptions on the type of people we would want to attract to this event and seek out that data on our own.

## Predicting MLB player's salaries

[Project details](https://jzbooth.github.io/Booth_Metis/Project_2/)

For my second project I was given the freedom to choose my topic.  The project centered around using an ordinary least squares linear regression to perform some sort of prediction.  Additionally we were required to scrape our data off of the internet from the raw html.  The topic I chose was to use a linear regression to determine which statistcs are most useful in predicting a MLB player's salary.

## Classifying credit card defaults

[Project details](https://jzbooth.github.io/Booth_Metis/Project_3/)

For my third project I was given the challenge of using classification models on data with binary outcomes.  I chose to classify credit card users on whether or not they would deafult.  The data was gathered from the UCI machine learning repository and contained information on users from Taiwan. A summary of the project can be found by clicking on the above link.

## Real estate descriptions

[Project details](https://jzbooth.github.io/Booth_Metis/Project_4/)

For my fourth project I was challenged to find text data that I would then use natrural language processing techiniques and unsupervised clustering algorithms to gain insight into the data.  I chose to get real estate descriptions from Zillow from Western Washington to perform my analysis on.  The data contains descriptions as well as numerical data and I hope to be able to determine what types of language real estate brokers can use to sell houses faster.  A summary of the project can be found by clicking on the above link.

WARNING: Use this code at your own risk, scraping is against Zillow's TOC.

Zillow home listings scraper, using Selenium.  The code takes as input search 
terms that would normally be entered on the Zillow home page.  It creates 11 
variables on each home listing from the data, saves them to a data frame, 
and then writes the df to a CSV file that gets saved to your working directory.

Software requirements/info:
- This code was written using Python 3.5.
- Scraping is done with Selenium v3.0.2, which can pip installed, or downloaded
  here: http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
- The selenium package requires a webdriver program. This code was written 
  using Chromedriver v2.25, which can be downloaded here: 
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

# Create list of search terms.
# Function zipcodes_list() creates a list of US zip codes that will be 
# passed to the scraper. For example, st = zipcodes_list(["10", "11", "606"])  
# will yield every US zip code that begins with "10", begins with "11", or 
# begins with "606", as a list object.
# I recommend using zip codes, as they seem to be the best option for catching
# as many house listings as possible. If you want to use search terms other 
# than zip codes, simply skip running zipcodes_list() function below, and add 
# a line of code to manually assign values to object st, for example:
# st = ["Chicago", "New Haven, CT", "77005", "Jacksonville, FL"]
# Keep in mind that, for each search term, the number of listings scraped is 
# capped at 520, so in using a search term like "Chicago" the scraper would 
# end up missing most of the results.

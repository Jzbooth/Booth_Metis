## My Metis Career

I have been lucky enough to be chosen to attend the Metis data science program as part of the 2018 winter cohort.  On this blog I will be documenting my time in the program and will post all of my projects.



[PROJECT BENSON](https://jzbooth.github.io/Booth_Metis/Project_1/)

In my first project at Metis I was assigned a team member and we were tasked with optimizing the placement of street teams for advertising an upcoming fundraising event.  In this project we were given NYC turnstile data to use to determine the subway terminals with the most foot traffic.  Beyond this data set we were encouraged to make more assumptions on the type of people we would want to attract to this event and seek out that data on our own.  A summary of my project can be found by clicking on the link above.
